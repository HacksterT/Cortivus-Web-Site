# Cortivus Chatbot Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### UI/UX Refactor & Feature Consolidation (June 29, 2025)

- âœ… **Resolved Critical Conflicts:** Addressed core stability issues by refactoring `ui.js` into a pure view layer and `chat.js` into a dedicated controller, eliminating all event listener conflicts and race conditions.
- âœ… **Centralized Logic:** All chatbot state, event handling, and message logic are now managed cleanly and reliably within `chat.js`.
- âœ… **Unified User Actions:** Replaced the header dropdown with a clear, interactive set of quick-reply buttons on chat open ("Policy Demo," "Sermon Demo," "Company Info," and "Contact Us").
- âœ… **Enhanced User Guidance:** Implemented a new welcome message and placeholder responses for all quick-reply actions to better guide the user.
- âœ… **Branding Update:** Updated the chatbot title to "The Cortivus Brain" and aligned the welcome message for consistent branding.
- âœ… **Removed Dead Code:** Deleted the `debug.js` script and all related logic for a cleaner, more efficient codebase.

### Project Setup and Planning

- âœ… Created detailed implementation plan in `bot_plan.md`
- âœ… Defined efficient folder structure for minimal impact on existing site
- âœ… Updated README.md with project structure documentation
- âœ… Fixed button styling issues in main website CSS

### Frontend Development

- âœ… Created core chat module (`js/chatbot/chat.js`)
- âœ… Built UI components (`js/chatbot/ui.js`)
- âœ… Created demo data
- âœ… Integrated chatbot script into main website pages
- âœ… Tested UI with demo mode

### Backend Development

- âœ… Set up Azure Function structure
- âœ… Implemented Python backend components
- âœ… Added configuration files

## Next Steps

### Testing and Optimization

- ðŸ”² Test end-to-end functionality with a live backend
- ðŸ”² Optimize token usage and response times
- ðŸ”² Verify mobile responsiveness
- ðŸ”² Test error handling scenarios

### Documentation and Deployment

- ðŸ”² Update documentation with deployment details
- ðŸ”² Create maintenance guide
- ðŸ”² Deploy to production environment

## Technical Notes

### Frontend

- The chatbot UI is implemented as a floating button that expands into a chat window.
- All styling is contained within the UI module to avoid conflicts with existing CSS.
- Demo mode allows testing without backend connectivity.

### Backend

- Azure Function uses Python with FastAPI structure.
- MiniMax M1 API integration with secure key handling.
- RAG system integration with caching for performance.

### Security

- API keys stored in Azure Key Vault.
- CORS configured to allow only GitHub Pages domain.
- Input validation on both client and server.

### Performance

- Local storage for conversation history.
- Caching for common queries.
- Optimized token usage for cost management.
