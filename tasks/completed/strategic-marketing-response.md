# Cortivus Go-to-Market Strategy Framework

## Synthesized Strategic Guidance from the LLM Council

---

## Executive Summary

Your challenge isn't launching another SaaS product—it's introducing a premium career intelligence service to sophisticated, time-poor healthcare executives who trust peer validation above all else. This framework provides the strategic pillars to launch your invite-only pilot and transition to controlled growth, with tactical depth you can drill into as needed.

---

## 1. Strategic Positioning: Reframe the Category

### The Critical Insight

Your biggest competitor isn't resume writers or ChatGPT—it's your prospect's belief they can "wing it" or that $249/month is expensive for "career software." To justify premium pricing, you must **escape the software category entirely.**

**The Trap:** "AI Resume Builder for Healthcare" (Perceived Value: $20-50/month)

**The Pivot:** "Your 24/7 Career Chief of Staff" (Perceived Value: $500+/month)

### Positioning Statement

*For healthcare executives who speak both clinical and business languages but struggle to translate career achievements between them, Cortivus is the AI-powered career intelligence platform that transforms clinical excellence into quantified executive value—because your 40% infection reduction deserves to be recognized as the $2.3M strategic win it represents.*

### Price Anchoring Strategy

Anchor against  **what you're replacing** , not competing software:

* Executive coaches: $500/hour
* Healthcare-specialized resume services: $2,000-5,000 one-time
* Search firm placement fees: $50,000+
* Cost of career stagnation: $50-200K in delayed promotions

**Your message:** "For less than one billable clinical hour per month, access unlimited career intelligence."

## 2. Core Messaging Architecture

### Primary Message

**"Your clinical impact has executive value. We help you prove it."**

### Supporting Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Why It Works | |--------|---------|--------------| | **Translation, Not Creation** | "You speak Clinical. They speak Capital. Cortivus makes you fluent in both." | Acknowledges their expertise; positions as amplifier | | **Living Intelligence** | "Enrich once. Deploy everywhere." | Differentiates from one-time services | | **Healthcare-Native** | "Built by executives who speak both languages" | Establishes credibility over generic tools |

### Messaging by Use Case

**The Job Hunter:** "Get the interview by translating clinical impact into business ROI."

**The Aspiring Board Member:** "The difference between 'managed a team' and 'optimized labor utilization by 15%' is Cortivus."

**The New Leader:** "Survive your first 100 days with an onboarding roadmap built on your complete career context."

**The Established Executive:** "Preparing for a board seat? Dealing with a difficult CEO? Your discreet strategic partner."

### Pilot-Specific Messaging

* "Join the invite-only founding cohort"
* "Shape the future of healthcare executive career intelligence"
* "Founder-level access including direct mentorship—never available again at this level"

---

## 3. Target Audience Refinement

### Primary Personas

**"The Rising CMO"** (Age 42-50)

* Surgeon or specialist turned leader
* Actively seeking C-suite roles
* **Pain:** Knows clinical wins matter but can't articulate ROI
* **Primary use:** Job Aid + Interview Coaching
* **Urgency:** High

**"The Seasoned Director"** (Age 52-62)

* 20+ years combined experience
* Eyeing board seats or portfolio career
* **Pain:** Underselling decades of transformation work
* **Primary use:** Mentor + Narrative customization
* **Urgency:** Medium-high

**"The Strategic Optimizer"** (Age 45-55)

* VP-level, well-positioned
* Wants speaking engagements, consulting opportunities
* **Pain:** Same CV for every opportunity
* **Primary use:** Living profile + unlimited outputs
* **Urgency:** Medium (but high retention potential)

### Pilot User Selection Criteria

Select your 5 users to represent different use cases for comprehensive feedback:

* 1 actively job searching (tests Job Aid urgency)
* 1 positioning for board role (tests executive narrative)
* 1 recently promoted (tests 100-day transition + Mentor)
* 1 planning 18-24 month move (tests Tutor skills development)
* 1 established seeking optimization (tests ongoing value/retention)

## 4. Phased Go-to-Market Approach

### Phase 1: Concierge Pilot (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Validate product-market fit and generate proof stories

**The Offer:** "Founder's Pilot"—platform access + your direct mentorship

**Week 0-1: Onboarding**

* 60-minute 1:1 intake session (you personally)
* Profile enrichment through guided AI + your expert overlay
* Set specific career objective for pilot period

**Weeks 2-12: Active Use**

* Weekly 30-minute check-ins
* Unlimited platform access
* Document every use case, win, and friction point

**Week 13: Transition**

* Comprehensive case study development
* Video testimonial capture
* Convert to Founding Member status

**Critical "Aha!" Moment:** During the first session, deliberately translate one specific "soft" clinical win into a quantified business metric. This locks belief in the system.

### Phase 2: Controlled Growth (Months 4-9)

**Goal:** Scale to 50-100 users while maintaining quality

**Founding Member Program:**

* Pilot users become "Founding Members" at $199/month (lifetime)
* 3 invitation codes to extend to peers ("Nomination" system)
* Quarterly exclusive roundtable with you
* Referred users get "Invited Member" status at $229/month (lifetime)

**Standard pricing launches:** $249/month

* Annual option: $2,490 (2 months free)
* Target: 30% annual pre-pay by month 12

### Phase 3: Scale Preparation (Months 10-12)

**Goal:** Build systems for 100-500 users

* Systematize onboarding (group sessions, self-serve resources)
* Hire Customer Success Lead (healthcare background essential)
* Expand marketing channels based on validated CAC
* Maintain founder touchpoints (monthly webinars, quarterly roundtables)

---

## 5. Channel Strategy: The "Velvet Rope" Approach

Healthcare executives value exclusivity and peer validation. Your channels must reflect this.

### Pilot Launch (Months 1-3)

**Primary:** Direct Personal Outreach

* Emails, LinkedIn DMs, personal calls to your network
* Make them  *apply* —simulate the executive search experience
* Target: 5 committed pilot users within 30 days

**Secondary:** Simple Landing Page

* Waitlist for non-pilot interest
* Email capture for "Clinical-to-Executive Translation Framework" guide

### Controlled Growth (Months 4-9)

**LinkedIn Thought Leadership (Founder-Led)**

*Content Archetype: "Translation Teardowns"*

* Take anonymous clinical resume bullet points
* Show how a CFO reads it vs. how it should be written
* Post 2-3x/week
* CTA: "DM me 'Translate' to apply for access"

*Example post:*

> **Before:** "Led quality improvement initiative reducing surgical site infections"
>
> **After:** "Designed and implemented SSI prevention protocol achieving 40% reduction, translating to $2.3M annual savings through reduced readmission penalties and shortened LOS"
>
> The first is a clinical achievement. The second is a board-ready business outcome.

**Strategic Partnerships**

Target organizations:

* ACHE (American College of Healthcare Executives) - 48,000 members
* AAPL (American Association for Physician Leadership)
* HIMSS physician leadership programs
* Healthcare executive MBA programs

Partnership model:

* Educational webinars (you provide expertise)
* Member-exclusive trial periods
* Co-branded career resources

**The Nomination Referral System**

* Instead of "Refer a Friend" (feels cheap), use nominations
* "You're part of our Founding 50. You have 3 invitations to nominate a peer for access."
* Each referral extends founder rate by 1 month (cap at 10)

### Scale Phase (Months 10+)

**Paid Acquisition Testing** (only after 6+ months conversion data):

* LinkedIn Ads targeting healthcare executive titles
* Sponsored content in healthcare leadership newsletters
* Target CAC: <$500 (2-month payback at $249/month)

## 6. Addressing the Retention Challenge

The biggest risk to your model is users canceling after landing a role. You must market ongoing value aggressively.

### The Lifecycle Messaging Map

| Stage | Primary Module | Message | |-------|---------------|---------| | Job Hunting | Job Aid | "Translate your impact. Get the interview." | | Interviewing | Job Aid + Tutor | "AI coaching that knows your gaps against *this specific* role" | | First 100 Days | Job Aid (Transition) | "Your onboarding roadmap built on complete career context" | | Established | Mentor + Tutor | "Board readiness. Difficult conversations. Your discreet strategic partner." |

### Retention Tactics

* Monthly all-member webinars on executive topics
* Quarterly "Board Readiness" content series (aspirational hook)
* Community connection (private Slack/Circle for members)
* Feature releases tied to career lifecycle (not just job search)

---

## 7. Metrics Dashboard

### North Star Metric

**Active Enriched Profiles:** Users who completed profile enrichment AND used platform in last 30 days

### Pilot Phase Metrics (Months 1-3)

| Category | Metric | Target | |----------|--------|--------| | Activation | Time to enriched profile | <7 days | | Activation | Profile enrichment completion | 100% | | Engagement | Return usage within 7 days | 100% | | Validation | "Would pay $249/month?" | 5/5 yes | | Validation | "Would recommend to peer?" | 5/5 yes | | Advocacy | Case studies generated | 3+ | | Advocacy | Video testimonials captured | 3+ |

### Growth Phase Metrics (Months 4-12)

| Category | Metric | Target | |----------|--------|--------| | Acquisition | Trial-to-paid conversion | 60%+ | | Acquisition | CAC | <$500 | | Retention | Monthly churn | <5% | | Retention | 90-day retention | >80% | | Revenue | MRR growth | Track weekly | | Revenue | Annual pre-pay mix | 30% by M12 | | Advocacy | Referral rate | 30% of users refer 1+ | | Advocacy | NPS | 70+ |

### Leading Indicators to Watch

## 8. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Trigger | Response | |------|---------|----------| | **Low pilot enrollment** | Can't fill 5 slots in 30 days | Expand network, offer fully-free pilot, reduce commitment to 6 weeks | | **Low trial conversion** | <40% after 20 trials | Extend trial to 14 days, add midpoint call, test $199 standard price | | **High churn** | >8% monthly for 2 consecutive months | Cohort analysis, user interviews, enhance community, add quarterly commitment options | | **Referrals don't materialize** | <15% referral rate after 6 months | Increase incentives (3 months free per referral), create shareable case studies | | **AI skepticism** | Qualitative feedback shows distrust | Lead with "human intelligence meets AI," emphasize your mentorship centrally | | **Perceived as "just another tool"** | Users compare to ChatGPT | Double down on specialization messaging, showcase healthcare-specific translation examples |

## 9. Immediate Action Plan

### This Week

1. **Finalize pilot user list** - Confirm 5 committed participants across different use cases
2. **Create the "Clinical-to-Business Dictionary"** - 10 common clinical achievements mapped to C-suite language (use as marketing asset AND onboarding tool)
3. **Set up payment infrastructure** - Stripe account, basic billing

### This Month

1. **Complete all pilot onboardings** - 90-minute deep-dive sessions
2. **Begin LinkedIn presence** - 2 "Translation Teardown" posts per week
3. **Document everything** - Every insight, friction point, and win

### This Quarter

1. **Deliver exceptional pilot experience** - These 5 become your evangelists
2. **Build proof assets** - Video testimonials, written case studies, quantified outcomes
3. **Validate pricing** - Confirm 5/5 willingness to pay $249/month
4. **Prepare for controlled launch** - Founding Member program, first 25 target users identified

### End of Quarter 1 Decision Point

* Did 5/5 pilots convert to paid?
* Would they recommend to peers?
* Do you have 3+ strong case studies?

**YES to all → Proceed to controlled growth** **NO to any → Extend pilot, iterate product**

## 10. Critical Success Factors

### 1. Proof Stories Beat Perfect Product

One executive who landed a role using Cortivus is worth 10 features. Prioritize case study development over feature expansion. Video testimonials > written testimonials.

### 2. Community Creates Retention

Healthcare executives are relationship-driven. Build peer connection opportunities early. Your voice + peer voices = compounding trust.

### 3. Specialization Is Your Moat

Never dilute to "all professionals." Healthcare executive focus = premium positioning. Deep expertise > broad reach.

### 4. High-Touch Early, Systems Later

* First 50 users: You're deeply involved
* Users 51-200: Systematize your insights
* Users 201+: Team delivers, you guide strategy

### 5. You're Selling Transformation, Not Software

The moment you compete on features, you lose. Compete on outcomes: roles landed, boards joined, confidence gained, compensation increased.

---

## The Bottom Line

Your unfair advantage is deep healthcare executive expertise combined with AI-powered scale. Win through specialization, prove value through transformed careers, and scale through peer networks.

This is a relationship business that technology amplifies—never the reverse. The executives who succeed with Cortivus will become your most powerful marketing channel. Serve them exceptionally, document their wins, and let them bring you the next 100 users.
