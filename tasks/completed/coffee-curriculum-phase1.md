# Phase 1: Foundation: Core Stages and Terminology

Hey Troy, welcome to Phase 1 of your Coffee Roasting syllabus—let's build your working foundation! We'll break down the four core roasting stages, key terms like ROR and cracks, and the chemistry shift from endothermic to exothermic. By the end, you'll spot these in any roast, setting you up for hands-on mastery.

## 1.1 Roasting Stages Overview

Troy, picture this: you're staring at a drum roaster loaded with green Ethiopian beans. They start grassy and wet, but over 10-15 minutes, they transform through four distinct stages into aromatic gold. Understanding these—Drying, Browning/Maillard, Development, and Cooling— is your roadmap to consistent roasts. Each has signature temps, times, smells, and chemistry shifts.

First up: **Drying Phase** (bean temps ~25-160°C / 77-320°F, lasting 4-6 minutes). Here, beans lose their 10-12% moisture down to 2-5%. It's all endothermic—beans suck up heat like a sponge, so Rate of Rise (ROR) slows. Smells? Grassy and hay-like. Miss this, and you'll bake flavors right out.

Next: **Browning/Maillard Phase** (~160-195°C / 320-383°F, 3-5 minutes). Aromas shift from grass to toast and bread as Maillard reactions kick in (more on that soon). ROR picks up as moisture's gone. This builds the base flavors.

**Development Phase** (post-First Crack, ~195-220°C / 383-428°F, 1-3 minutes). Beans expand, oils form—pure magic, but easy to overdo. Ends at Second Crack or your quench call.

Finally: **Cooling/Quenching** (immediate drop to <50°C / 122°F in 2-4 minutes). Fans or water cool beans fast to lock in flavors—no further cooking!

### Application
In a real drum roaster, watch the bean mass temp probe and listen/smell. For your Ethiopian, aim 10-minute total: drying to 5 min, develop 2 min post-crack. Practice by noting timestamps next roast—helps dial charge temp for steady ROR.

### Key Takeaways
- Drying: Heat-absorbing moisture loss, grassy aromas.
- Maillard: Flavor-building browning, bread smells.
- Development: Post-crack flavor peak, time it tight.
- Cooling: Quench fast to halt reactions.

## 1.2 Key Terminology: ROR, Cracks, and Reactions

Building on those stages, Troy, let's decode the lingo you'll hear in every roastery. Terms like ROR, cracks, and reactions aren't jargon—they're your controls for avoiding flat (under-developed) or burnt (over-developed) coffee. Think drum roaster: steady curves mean pro roasts.

**Rate of Rise (ROR)**: Bean temp increase per minute (°F/min or °C/min). Starts low in drying (endothermic drag), peaks mid-Maillard, dips if stalling. Target: smooth downward curve post-charge for even roast—no crashes!

**First Crack** (~166-177°C / 330-350°F, ~8-10 min in). Exothermic explosion: gases from Maillard pressure beans to audibly snap like popcorn. Marks development start—~10% roast weight loss.

**Second Crack** (~205-215°C / 401-419°F). Finer, rolling crack; oils migrate, fruity notes emerge. Risky zone—overdo for ashiness.

**Maillard Reaction**: Amino acids + sugars → nutty, bready flavors (Maillard phase). **Caramelization**: Sugars break down post-crack for sweetness. Balance them via development time to dodge under (grassy) or over (bitter).

### Application
On a roast curve graph, plot ROR dropping through cracks. Example: Ethiopian at FC (9 min, ROR +10°F/min), develop 90 sec to quench. Quiz yourself: What's ROR crash? (Stall from too-cool charge—fixes with hotter start.)

### Key Takeaways
- ROR: Temp rise speed—smooth curve = balanced roast.
- First Crack: Gas release, development begins.
- Maillard/Caramelization: Build nutty/sweet flavors.
- Cracks signal shifts—time development precisely.

## 1.3 Endothermic to Exothermic Chemistry Basics

Troy, now the 'why' behind the stages: chemistry drives everything. Beans shift from heat-hungry (endothermic) to heat-releasing (exothermic), like a slow cooker turning into a pressure bomb. Ignore it, and your roast stalls or scorches.

Early **endothermic** (drying/Maillard start): Beans absorb heat for evaporation and reactions—ROR slows as energy fights physics. Beans swell 50-100%, volume doubles.

Pivots at First Crack to **exothermic** (development): Gases/oils from breakdowns release heat, spiking ROR. Beans crack audibly (pressure pop), per studies like those from Scott Rao—expansion hits 13-15% weight loss.

If ignored? Too endothermic long = baked 'hay bombs.' Exothermic runaway = crash ROR, scorching. Willem Boot notes: steady shift yields clean cups.

### Application
Monitor ROR inflection: drying dip, Maillard rise, FC exothermic bump. Real-world: Adjust gas pre-FC to tame exothermic surge. Explain back: 'Endothermic drying pulls heat; exothermic cracks push it out—balance for flavor arc.'

### Key Takeaways
- Endothermic: Heat in > out, slows ROR early.
- Exothermic: Heat out > in, accelerates post-FC.
- Shift at cracks—track to avoid stalls/scorches.
- Beans expand audibly; chemistry = flavor control.

## Activity: Map a Hypothetical Roast Timeline

**Objective:** Build a mental timeline for a 12-minute drum roast of green Ethiopian beans, labeling stages, ROR shifts, aromas (grass → hay/bread per Willem Boot), cracks, and quench—solidifying Phase 1 concepts.

**Steps:**
1. Grab paper/graph app. Draw X-axis (0-15 min), Y-axis (bean temp 0-220°C). Mark charge at 0 min (~180°C drum).
2. Label Drying (0-5 min): End ~160°C, grassy→hay aromas, low ROR (2-5°C/min). Note 10% moisture loss.
3. Add Maillard (5-9 min): 160-195°C, bread aromas, rising ROR. Input: When does it end? (Pre-FC signs: color deepens).
4. Plot Development (9-11 min): FC at 9 min (~170°C, snaps), ROR bump (exothermic). Second Crack hint at 10.5 min. Fruity notes.
5. Mark Quench (11 min): Drop to cool. Total time 12 min. Sketch ROR curve: dip early, peak mid, smooth decline.
6. Review: Does ROR crash? (No—steady endothermic→exothermic). Adjust your map for balance.

**Expected Outcome:** A labeled 12-min roast profile sketch with stages, ROR notes, aromas/cracks—your first 'virtual roast log' ready for real application.
**Time:** 12 minutes

## Reflection

Consider the following questions:
- What key insights did you gain on the four stages, ROR behavior, and endothermic/exothermic shifts?
- What frictions or confusions arose (e.g., crack timing or ROR curves)?
- How might you apply this to spotting stages in a real drum roast next time?
- List 1-2 questions you have for Phase 2.

**Journal Prompt:** Jot how mastering these foundations changes your view of a 'good roast'—from guesswork to science.

Troy, you've nailed the foundation: stages flow from drying endothermic drag to development exothermic fireworks, guided by ROR and cracks. Your timeline activity ties it together for real roasts. Next phase, we'll profile and experiment—keep that map handy!
