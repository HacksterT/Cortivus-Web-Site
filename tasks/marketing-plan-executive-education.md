**Core Offer:** Strategic Mentoring + AI Tools (Curriculum Utility, Project Writer, Custom Automation)  
**Positioning:** "Lead with Precision. Scale with AI."

---

## Executive Summary

Cortivus Executive Education is a **premium, low-volume, high-touch** offering. The goal is not mass-market reach but **strategic positioning** to attract 5-10 high-value clients per quarter who need executive mentorship combined with practical AI implementation.

## Risk Mitigation

### Challenge: "I don't have time for marketing"

**Solution:** Batch content creation. Spend 2 hours on Sunday writing 3 LinkedIn posts for the week. Use AI (ChatGPT) to draft, then personalize.

### Challenge: "What if no one responds to outreach?"

**Solution:** Focus on warm network first. Offer value before asking for anything (share an article, make an intro, etc.).

### Challenge: "How do I prove ROI of mentorship?"

**Solution:** Track client wins (promotions, successful AI implementations, time saved). Use these as case studies.

## Final Thoughts

**This is a relationship business.** The tools (Curriculum Utility, Project Writer) are **proof of competence**, but the real product is **Dr. Sybert's experience and strategic insight**.

The marketing plan focuses on **demonstrating expertise** (LinkedIn, articles, webinars) and **building trust** (warm outreach, referrals, case studies). The goal is not to "sell" but to **attract the right people** who already know they need help.

**Start small, iterate fast, and let client results do the marketing.**
