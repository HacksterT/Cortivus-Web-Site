    "- **Centralized Logic:** All chatbot state and event logic managed cleanly within `chat.js`.\n",
    "- **Unified User Actions:** Dropdown replaced with clear quick-reply buttons:  \n",
    "  _Policy Demo, Sermon Demo, Company Info, Contact Us_\n",
    "- **Enhanced User Guidance:** Added welcome message and placeholder responses per demo.\n",
    "- **Branding Update:** Chatbot renamed to **\"The Cortivus Brain\"**, with updated welcome branding.\n",
    "- **Removed Dead Code:** Eliminated `debug.js` and related functions.\n",
    "- **UI Improvements:**  \n",
    "  - 2x2 quick-reply button grid  \n",
