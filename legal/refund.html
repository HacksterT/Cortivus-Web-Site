                <h2>7-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
                <p>We want you to feel confident in your investment. All Cortivus subscriptions come with a <strong>7-day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you are not satisfied with the Platform for any reason, you may request a full refund within 7 days of your initial subscription purchase.</p>

                <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
                <p>To request a refund within the 7-day window:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Email <a href="mailto:servingyou@cortivus.com">servingyou@cortivus.com</a> with the subject line "Refund Request"</li>
                    <li>Include the email address associated with your account</li>
                    <li>We will process your refund within 5 business days</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Refunds are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong>, our payment provider. The refund will be returned to your original payment method. Processing times may vary depending on your bank or card issuer.</p>

                <h2>After the 7-Day Window</h2>
                <p>After the initial 7-day period, subscriptions are non-refundable. However, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cancel anytime</strong> — Your subscription will remain active through the end of your current billing period. You will not be charged again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manage your subscription</strong> — Update your payment method or billing details through the Paddle customer portal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cancellation does not trigger a refund for the current billing period. You retain full access to the Platform until the end of the period you have already paid for.</p>

                <h2>Subscription Renewals</h2>
                <p>The 7-day money-back guarantee applies to your <strong>initial subscription purchase only</strong>. Monthly renewals are non-refundable. If you no longer wish to use the Platform, cancel before your next billing date to avoid being charged.</p>

                <h2>Price Changes</h2>
                <p>If we increase subscription prices, you will receive at least 30 days' notice. If you do not wish to continue at the new price, you may cancel before the change takes effect without penalty.</p>
                <p>Founding Member pricing is locked in perpetuity as stated on the <a href="/pricing/">pricing page</a>.</p>

                <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
                <p>We may consider refunds outside the 7-day window in exceptional circumstances, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extended platform outages that significantly impacted your ability to use the service</li>
                    <li>Billing errors or duplicate charges</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are handled on a case-by-case basis. Contact us at <a href="mailto:servingyou@cortivus.com">servingyou@cortivus.com</a> to discuss.</p>
